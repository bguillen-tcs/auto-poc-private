# Intuit Auto POC - Private

## Description

Similar to the initial POC (see it [here](https://github.com/bguillen-tcs/auto-poc)), but with two differences.

1. Simpler: It only has one package, `components`
2. Private: As the name implies, it was used to test how `auto` works with private repo and packages.  It proved that it would work just fine!  It was turned to public for the sake of adding visibility to it.

Again, given the similarities between this and the original POC linked above, check that `README.md` for more detail.
